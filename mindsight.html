<pre>
return to your houses
over the eastern waters

sun shines over houses alone
for the flow
they see you waiting for the show

are you coming back okay?
i wander around
seeing faces that i know
are unfamiliar

to others in hiding, guess through the lens
mystery is festering all around
it can change for you

i don't want
responsibility

confine what remains in it's cage
for the love
life we're soaring above

are you coming back okay?
i'm wandering around
seeing faces that i know
are unfamiliar

to others who helped me try to begin
destiny can capture me like a fly
it can change for us
</pre>
