<h2>baby son adoring us</h2>
<pre>
brain so glorious
baby son adoring us
gift of existence

stain, don't conquer
sustain, just conquer

glorious
baby son adoring us
can he go away?
</pre>
<h2>new normal</h2>
<pre>
sunrise

it's time

it's time

step out into the new normal
embrace the day with your shame
goodbye to those who cannot join us
their voices are still heard in every word that we say

as we blend into the new normal
familiar path, different place
you dawn yesterday's smile
decorate you new face
</pre>
<h2>mirror mirror</h2>
<pre>
mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to be so small?
your vision is electrical

mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to see us all
entering the 3D plane?
you don't take up anything

behold, we see
you'll show us what we don't know

(did i say don't? i mean you'll show us what we know)

mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to be so small?
your no one, and you want more

(ding ding ding ding)
</pre>
<h2>love will</h2>
<pre>
just seeing you i knew
a bond between us two a-grew, and
love spilled out the open doors
and smeared around the kitchen floor

to optional complexity
contorted into harmony
and blood wont travel through those veins but
love will, oh, love will
</pre>
<h2>there's something happening</h2>
<pre>
there's something happening
there's something happening too
isn't it fair?

no, i don't know if it ever will be
it's really nice
oh, it's really nice to not meet you
because i'm scared
some day you might actually see me

(scratch that, i'm ready)

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too

oh, ahh, ay, ooh, oh, ah, ah
look at all the beautiful hair you got!

i'm planning big things
suckle on the medicine
you look like a child, and
i'm like thomas edison
off from my body
suckle on the medicine
slip into a sore and
cut my thomas edison

(live and you lose, you sycophantic star)
(you know where i are!)

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too

i don't need to worry (wha-what?)
it's impossibke to go (oh, that's true)
i don't need to worry, it's a waste of my fear

what have i been saying?
time and time again?
why would you listen now if you didn't listen then?

get along, please understand me
your fancies are demanding

hangman
for any

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we-) (do it again!)
close-up (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(come on)
(any reason?)
(no)

(i left a note for all the new things)

every time you catch me off my guard, it's like a thousand dollars
married them, and taking off their wedding rings and singing happily

it used to sound so good to be, and it used to sound so good to me
it doesn't sound so go to be, it never sounded good to me!

at last, with open arms
ask if i can take my time
i am back, declaring me in
i'll prepare when i go!

(pauses not in mind, see yours is so many 'cause you shouldn't just rule)

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

<h2>out the ox</h2>
<pre>
kissing your hand
roll back your eye
now your outside
grass is so nice

slip in the back
startle my friend
has heart attack
he's dead again (oh!)

hope you know, i don't blame you
we were jonesing for the ride, oh
pop the gum that i gave you
keep on dozing to the right, oh

work while i work
back in my head
you're out the ox
i'm seeing red

give me console
give me control
picking the bone
that's in my head!

hope you know, i don't blame you
we were jonesing for the ride, oh
pop the gum that i gave you
keep on dozing to the right, oh

flip down my hair
and get you in the bed
i could be thoughtless as you are but you are this way instead
no time for that
she lives from mattress to mattress
and they all say Mary Magdalene is no way around!
(oh, no!)

just say you're coming home
then i'll be home, oh

and just say you're coming home
and i'll be home

and i'll be home
i'll be home
and i'll be home
for you

kissing your hand
roll back your eye
now your outside
grass is so nice

slip in the back
startle my friend
has heart attack
he's dead again

hope you know, i don't blame you
we were jonesing for the ride, oh
pop the gum that i gave you
keep on dozing to the right, oh

<h2>dinner is not over</h2>
<pre>
dinner is not over
dinner is not over
dinner is not over
dinner is not over

you say something's wrong
and i could say the same to you
broken over and over again
what else could i do?

i've tasted friendship
i've tasted you
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!
i've tasted heartbreak
i've tasted food
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!

but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
but that's dessert
but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
so put it down

dinner is not over
dinner is not over
dinner is not over
dinner is not over

you no more ways
and now you've got to choose
you said "i've got the power to go any time!"
darling, it's true

i've tasted friendship
i've tasted you
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!
i've tasted heartbreak
i've tasted food
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!

but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
but that's dessert
but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
so put it-

one
two
rise and leave me
blind (alright)
and i feel coming all the time (no way)
but i really wanna draw the line (okay)
when you wanna keep me outta my mind (hey what)

you want to put me down until i'm fine
down until i'm fine

boy
you're tearing apart (no way)
and i wanna-wanna multiply (okay)
but i'm never gonna see the light (hey what)

'cause everybody's gonna hold me down until i'm fine
down until i'm fine

middle of the story
we got all the past in view
got where living was something you do
for the time

i've tasted friendship
i've tasted you
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!
i've tasted heartbreak
i've tasted food
i've tasted dying and it tasted good!

but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
but that's dessert
but that's dessert (you can have it when the dinner is gone)
so put it down!...
