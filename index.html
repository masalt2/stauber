<h2></h2>
<h2>baby son adoring us</h2>
brain so glorious
baby son adoring us
gift of existence

stain, don't conquer
sustain, just conquer

glorious
baby son adoring us
can he go away?

<h2>new normal</h2>
sunrise

it's time

it's time

step out into the new normal
embrace the day with your shame
goodbye to those who cannot join us
their voices are still heard in every word that we say

as we blend into the new normal
familiar path, different place
you dawn yesterday's smile
decorate you new face

<h2>mirror mirror</h2>
mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to be so small?
your vision is electrical

mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to see us all
entering the 3D plane?
you don't take up anything

behold, we see
you'll show us what we don't know

(did i say don't? i mean you'll show us what we know)

mirror mirror on the wall
what's it like to be so small?
your no one, and you want more

(ding ding ding ding)

<h2>love will</h2>
just seeing you i knew
a bond between us two a-grew, and
love spilled out the open doors
and smeared around the kitchen floor

to optional complexity
contorted into harmony
and blood wont travel through those veins but
love will, oh, love will

<h2>there's something happening</h2>
there's something happening
there's something happening too
isn't it fair?

no, i don't know if it ever will be
it's really nice
oh, it's really nice to not meet you
because i'm scared
some day you might actually see me

(scratch that, i'm ready)

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too

oh, ahh, ay, ooh, oh, ah, ah
look at all the beautiful hair you got!

i'm planning big things
suckle on the medicine
you loook like a child, and
i'm like thomas edison
off from my body
suckle on the medicine
slip into a sore and
cut my thomas edison

(live and you lose, you sycophantic star)
(you know where i are!)

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too

i don't need to worry (wha-what?)
it's impossibke to go (oh, that's true)
i don't need to worry, it's a waste of my fear

what have i been saying?
time and time again?
why would you listen now if you didn't listen then?

get along, please understand me
your fancies are demanding

hangman
for any

close-up (wow!) (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we-) (do it again!)
close-up (honk! honk!)
(i look so beautiful!)
close-up (oh!) (honk! honk!)
(what do we beautiful do?)

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too

(ee!)
so you (oo!)
can enjoy it too
